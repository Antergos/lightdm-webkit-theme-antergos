lightdm-webkit-theme-antergos 2.0
=================================
The developing version of the default Antergos greeter theme.

#Testing
Note that being a webkit-greeter theme, this theme uses several webkit-specific tags. One easy choice is Midori, but be sure to not use Chrome/Chromium, as both now use -blink- tags!

#Installation
Coming soon.
